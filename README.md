# WebProfileSS
My plans for my website are to make it a formal location to showcase some of the art I have painted. I want to include a little about me, my background, and my major. I plan to make this website all one page and when you click on different tabs, it scrolls you down to that part of the page. My hopes for this website are for it to be aesthetic and concise, but a useful resource to include in a resume. I also plan to match the colors to those that I have in my resume profile picture.
